## 📚 How to Use the Snippets

These snippets are tailored to help new developers focus on coding logic rather than syntax. Here are a few ways they can be used:

- **Switch Statement**: Type `switchtemplate` and press `Tab` to quickly generate a switch statement structure.
- **LINQ Queries**: Use snippets like `simplequery`, `groupbyquery`, or `orderbyquery` to generate commonly used LINQ query templates.
- **API Templates**: Quickly set up API endpoint templates with snippets like `postendpoint` or `putendpoint`.
- **Loops and Collections**: Use `foreachtmpl` for a `foreach` loop or `dictionaryquery` to generate a dictionary structure.
